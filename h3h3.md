# Final summary

## file descriptor 

there is a saying in UNIX system "everything is a file", this means most of the resources in UNIX system comes in form of file, either it was a pipes, console, driver, even file
itself. Because in almost every UNIX resource is file, in every process there was a file descriptor. what is a file descriptor? good question, file descriptor is a small integer
representing a kernel managed object that a process may read from or write to, in this topic case file system. file descriptor itself is an index that point into file descriptor
table (fdtab). As stated in chapter 0, in xv6 the kernel use the file descriptor as as an index per process table so every process has a private spaces of file descriptor starting
at 0. xv6 uses standard UNIX file descriptor 0 for standard input, 1 for standard output, and 2 for standard error. the read and write syscall read bytes from and writes bytes to 
open file named by file descriptor. Each open file were represented by struct file (see file.h) wich is only a wrapper around a inode and pipe plus an i/o offset, this reflected in
the code where one of struct file member were pointer to pipe and inode structs. every syscall open() will creates new struct file when multiple process that happen simultaneously 
in the same file then different instances off struct file will have different i/o offset as the identifier of each process. in other cases a single file (the single struct file) can
appear in file table of multiple process, this happens because if one process used open() to open the file and then created aliases using dup or shared it with child using fork.
A reference count tracks a number of references to a particular open file while readable and writeable track is the file can be open for reading or write or both.

```c
struct file {
  enum { FD_NONE, FD_PIPE, FD_INODE } type;
  int ref; // reference count
  char readable; // check if open file writable
  char writable; // check if open file can be read
  struct pipe *pipe; // pointer to pipe structure
  struct inode *ip; // pointer to inode structure
  uint off;
};
```

all open file in system were kept in global file table (ftable) there are 3 function in ftable: 

- filealloc 
    allocate a file
- filedup
    duplicate reference
- fileclose
    release reference
- fileread
    read data
- filewrite
    write data

### how does it work

- Filealloc

```c
struct file*
filealloc(void)
{
  struct file *f;

  acquire(&ftable.lock);
  for(f = ftable.file; f < ftable.file + NFILE; f++){
    if(f->ref == 0){
      f->ref = 1;
      release(&ftable.lock);
      return f;
    }
  }
  release(&ftable.lock);
  return 0;
}
```
first filealloc scan the table for unreferenced file ==> (f->ref == 0) and return a new references ==> (return f)

- Filedup

```c
struct file*
filedup(struct file *f)
{
  acquire(&ftable.lock);
  if(f->ref < 1)
    panic("filedup");
  f->ref++;
  release(&ftable.lock);
  return f;
}
```
filedup use similiar concept as filealloc, the differences here is it increment the references count ==> (f->ref++;)

- fileclose

```c
void
fileclose(struct file *f)
{
  struct file ff;

  acquire(&ftable.lock);
  if(f->ref < 1)
    panic("fileclose");
  if(--f->ref > 0){
    release(&ftable.lock);
    return;
  }
  ff = *f;
  f->ref = 0;
  f->type = FD_NONE;
  release(&ftable.lock);

  if(ff.type == FD_PIPE)
    pipeclose(ff.pipe, ff.writable);
  else if(ff.type == FD_INODE){
    begin_op();
    iput(ff.ip);
    end_op();
  }
}
```
in fileclose the reference count were decremented ==> ( if(--f->ref > 0) ), if the file references reach zero fileclose will release 
the underlying pipe or inode according to the type.

- fileread and filewrite

fileread and write check if the operation is allowed by the open mode and then pass the call through to pipe or inodes implementation.

## Code: System call

there's some syscall that closely related with file system in UNIX, this syscall were defined in "sysfile.c" file.

### sys_link and sys_unlink

The function of sys_link and sys_unlink edit directories, creating or removing references to existing inodes. sys_link works by using transactions, first sys_link begins
by fetching it's agrument, two strings old and new ( char name[DIRSIZ], *new, *old; ). If the old exist and it's not a directory, sys_link increments it's ip>nlink count.
then sys_link called nameinparent to find parent directory and final element of new and create new directory entry at old's inode, at this part the new parent directory
must exist and be on the same device as the existing inode. 

## Real-world use


# Real world use

## Buffer cache 

the buffer cache in real world is more complex than the use in xv6, but is serve the same purposes; caching and syncronize acces to the disk
xv6 uses the concept that was used in unix v6, the simple Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy, an efficient LRU would in theory eliminate the linked list and instead using a hash table for lookups
and heap for LRU evictions. Modern Buffer cache are typically integraterd with virtual memory system.

## Logging 

xv6 logging is inefficient for real world use, because a commit cannot occur concurently with file system call, this happen because the system logs the entire blocks even if only a few bytes of that
block changed. this commit perform syncronous log writes, a block at a time wich require an entire disk rotation time
